Hi Markus,

I have found your VideoCapture module really useful.  Thanks!!  I've
used it from python, and also found the source code helpful for some
other C++ stuff I was doing that didn't involve Python.

I had a problem with the displayCapturePinProperties - basically things
crashed when I called that.  I tweaked the code for that to make it look
a little more like the code for displayCaptureFilterProperties, which
called teardown at a different point, and then it seemed to work ok.

I also added a method for setting the resolution of the capture directly
without requiring a dialog.

I have no idea if you are interested, but I'm sending you the slightly
modified versions.  Also, here is a simple python HTTP server that can
deliver the images, and can also do server push, which could be played
in a netscape browser.  At low resolution (320x240) I get about 9fps
with it.

Anyway, if you don't want these source files, toss them in the
bitbucket.  But in anycase, I thank you for making VideoCapture
available.

Cheers,
Don Kimber
