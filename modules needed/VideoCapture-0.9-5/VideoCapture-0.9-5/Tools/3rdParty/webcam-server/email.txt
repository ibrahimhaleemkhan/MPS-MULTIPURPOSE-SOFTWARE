  I've found your video capture libraries to be very useful! Thank you for producing them and making them available!

  Based on your library, I've written a very simple web server that captures a fresh image on every image request. It's very, very simple, and can only serve captured images, not the wrapper site.

  I did it as part of a quickie demo for a potential client, but thought that it might prove useful to other people. Please feel free to discard it, add it into the Tools section of a future VideoCapture release, or whatever you feel is best.

  It was written with and tested on Python 2.2. It should work on older versions, but I'm not sure how far back.
